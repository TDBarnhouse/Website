                <p id="about-text">    
                    Heyo, I'm Tristan Barnhouse!<br>
                    I am a student currently at Kent State University pursuing my Master's of Science! I
                    am in the program for Computer Science with a concentration in Cybersecurity. I
                    obtained my Bachelor's of Science in both Computer Science and Mathematics with a
                    double minor in Computer and Network Security and Criminal Justice at the University
                    of Mount Union. My future plan with my degrees are to join the field of cybersecurity
                    more specifically, my dream is to be an ethical hacker. Ever since I was a child, I
                    have been fond of technology. As I grew older, my interests leaned towards the concept
                    of developing and hacking. As a result, I decided to explore these interests in my
                    personal time and college. When it comes to developing, I love being able to create
                    something I have a massive interest in. I love the idea of being able to come up with
                    an idea and watch it come alive. This has led me to create many side projects on my own
                    that are presented in my portfolio. One of these specifically was my mod menu, Unleash
                    the Beast, for the game Call of Duty: Black Ops 2. This is where my interest of hacking
                    came alive. This mod menu allowed me to manipulate files which was not intended. Although
                    I do love developing, I became more fond over the idea of ethical hacking when I
                    discovered this was a real career path. The idea of being able to do something 'illegal'
                    legally amazes me. I love challenges and when presented one, I put all my devotion in an
                    effort to complete the desired task; when it comes to pentesting, it is most definitely a
                    major challenge. By being assigned a task to ethically break into a company and discover any
                    vulnerabilities associated with it fascinates me. Thus, it has brought me to where I am
                    today. A student with the dream to pusure my interest in the field of cybersecurity and
                    to complete one of my life goals, an ethical hacker.

                            This is a GSC project for 
                            Call of Duty: Black Ops 2. 
                            When this project is 
                            injected into the gaming 
                            console of your choice, it 
                            will manipulate the game 
                            with whatever option you 
                            choose throughout the menu. <br><br>

                            </h2>
                            This was my first project when 
                            it came to developing. It was never 
                            completed because by the time I 
                            got into coding, the scene 
                            for modding and in general, Call 
                            of Duty: Black Ops 2, was 
                            nonexistent. As a result, I 
                            decided to give up on the 
                            project, but it would not be 
                            hard to complete. The base of 
                            the project is done and just 
                            needs the little details for 
                            each menu so perhaps one day I 
                            may go back and finish it.

                            be used within a server on Discord.

                            I have a Discord server amongst

                            found online through gaming. As a 
                            result, I have used many third-party 
                            bots for my own server. I ended up 
                            deciding to code my own to do simple 
                            commands I only need for my own 
                            community. I plan to develop more to 
                            it as I need with new commands and 
                            features.

                            This is a Typescript project for 
                            Discord. It uses the Discord Developer

                            Similar to Mini-Beastie, this is yet 
                            another bot I decided to develop, but 
                            give it one single purpose. My friends 
                            and I have always played music in our 
                            servers to listen together, but those 
                            bots were shutdown. In order to get 
                            music back running in my server, I 
                            decided to get my own bot running. Due 
                            to the application being very 
                            demanding and consistently having 
                            commands being used, I separated it 
                            from my original bot to keep the load 
                            off and allow both bots to run without 
                            any issues.

                            Instead of having a simple resume 
                            printed off to give to employers, I 
                            decided to be a little unique by 
                            having my own website. I made the 
                            decision to make my portfolio online 
                            for a variety of reasons. Besides 
                            helping me stand out more, I think it 
                            also allows the employer to be more 
                            interested and connected with me 
                            because they have to go through the 
                            entire website rather than just 
                            reading a piece of paper. Although I 
                            would still be supplying a physical 
                            copy, I think a website version is 
                            more enjoyable for everyone including 
                            myself.
