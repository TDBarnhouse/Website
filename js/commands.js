    "Heyo, I'm Tristan Barnhouse!<br>",
    "I am a student currently at Kent State University pursuing my Master's of Science! I",
    "am in the program for Computer Science with a concentration in Cybersecurity. I",
    "obtained my Bachelor's of Science in both Computer Science and Mathematics with a",
    "double minor in Computer and Network Security and Criminal Justice at the University",
    "of Mount Union. My future plan with my degrees are to join the field of cybersecurity",
    "more specifically, my dream is to be an ethical hacker. Ever since I was a child, I",
    "have been fond of technology. As I grew older, my interests leaned towards the concept",
    "of developing and hacking. As a result, I decided to explore these interests in my",
    "personal time and college. When it comes to developing, I love being able to create",
    "something I have a massive interest in. I love the idea of being able to come up with",
    "an idea and watch it come alive. This has led me to create many side projects on my own",
    "that are presented in my portfolio. One of these specifically was my mod menu, Unleash",
    "the Beast, for the game Call of Duty: Black Ops 2. This is where my interest of hacking",
    "came alive. This mod menu allowed me to manipulate files which was not intended. Although",
    "I do love developing, I became more fond over the idea of ethical hacking when I",
    "discovered this was a real career path. The idea of being able to do something 'illegal'",
    "legally amazes me. I love challenges and when presented one, I put all my devotion an,",
    "effort to complete the desire task; when it comes to pentesting, it is most definitely a",
    "major challenge. By being assigned a task to ethically break into a company and discover any",
    "vulnerabilities associated with it fascinates me. Thus, it has brought me to where I am",
    "today. A student with the dream to pusure my interest in the field of cybersecurity and",
    "to complete one of my life goals, an ethical hacker.",
